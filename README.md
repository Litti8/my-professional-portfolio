## 💻 How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm) installed.

### **Installation**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Litti8/my-professional-portfolio.git](https://github.com/Litti8/my-professional-portfolio.git)
    cd my-professional-portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### **Environment Variables Configuration**

This project uses environment variables to handle the contact form URL (Formspree).

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project (at the same level as `package.json`).
2.  **Add the following line** to the `.env` file, replacing `https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORMSPREE_FORM_ID` with your actual Formspree form URL. You can obtain this URL from [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) after setting up a new form.
    ```
    REACT_APP_FORMSPREE_URL=[https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORMSPREE_FORM_ID](https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORMSPREE_FORM_ID)
    ```
3.  **Ensure `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file** (it should be already if you followed previous steps).

### **Running the Development Server**

Once dependencies are installed and environment variables are configured:

```bash
npm start
```
